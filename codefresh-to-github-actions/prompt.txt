- Separate jobs for clone, build, test, security scan, and deploy
- Build Docker image and tag it with Git SHA
- Run Trivy and OWASP Dependency-Check in a separate 'security' job
- Use matrix strategy for testing on Python 3.8 and 3.11
- Deploy job should use secrets for production environment
- Send Slack alert if deploy job fails
